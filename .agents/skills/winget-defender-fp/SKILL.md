  Use when a ryl winget-pkgs validation PR is blocked by a Microsoft Defender
  false positive (`Validation-Defender-Error` / "Installer failed security

# Winget Defender False-Positive Triage

ryl ships **unsigned** Windows binaries (`InstallerType: zip` + `NestedInstallerType:
portable`). Microsoft Defender's cloud/ML heuristics intermittently flag the *downloaded*
ZIP (mark-of-the-web) as a trojan, failing the winget-pkgs validation. The packaging is
correct — this is a false positive, not a ryl bug. Code signing is the durable fix but is
deferred (#342); this loop is the interim process.

## Recognise it

- Labels: **`Validation-Defender-Error`** is the root cause; `Validation-Installation-Error`
  and `Validation-Executable-Error` are downstream cascades of the same block;
  `Needs-Author-Feedback` means the PR is waiting on you (reply, or it can be auto-closed).
- The moderator's "… Validation ended with" comment names the **detection** and the
  **artifact** (usually the x64 zip), e.g. `[FAIL] Installer failed security check. Url:
  …/ryl-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip … Detection: Trojan:Win32/Sprisky.U!cl`.
- The signature name **varies per release** (`Wacatac.H!ml`, `Sprisky.U!cl`, …); the
  `!ml`/`!cl` suffix means heuristic/cloud, not a content-signature match.
- Error codes: `0x8A15002D` = `APPINSTALLER_CLI_ERROR_INSTALLER_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILED`;
  `0x80004005` = `E_FAIL`.
- **Log noise to ignore** (always present, never the cause): the validator's WMI
  `wminet_utils.dll` `TypeInitializationException`, and `ryl.exe returned exit code: 2`
  (ryl's by-design no-args usage exit).

## Diagnose

The Azure validation pipeline is **public/anonymous**. From the wingetbot "Validation
Pipeline Run" link grab the `buildId`, then (project GUID
`8b78618a-7973-49d8-9174-4360829d979b`) read the timeline and the failed task's log (look
for the `Installation Validation` task):

```sh
base="https://dev.azure.com/shine-oss/8b78618a-7973-49d8-9174-4360829d979b/_apis/build/builds"
curl -s "$base/<buildId>/timeline?api-version=7.1"
curl -s "$base/<buildId>/logs/<logId>?api-version=7.1"
```

Reproduce locally (Windows, real-time protection ON — always record the signature build,
it is the key datum for the PR reply):

```powershell
$u = "https://github.com/owenlamont/ryl/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/ryl-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip"
try { Invoke-WebRequest $u -OutFile "$env:TEMP\ryl-check.zip" -ErrorAction Stop; "OK" }
catch { "BLOCKED: $($_.Exception.Message)" }   # a block/quarantine == reproduced
Start-MpScan -ScanType CustomScan -ScanPath "$env:TEMP\ryl-check.zip"
Get-MpThreatDetection | Sort-Object InitialDetectionTime -Descending |
  Select-Object -First 3 InitialDetectionTime, Resources
(Get-MpComputerStatus).AntivirusSignatureVersion
```

Cross-check **VirusTotal** — its Microsoft engine is the best proxy for the validator.
Look up by hash first (`https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/<sha256-lowercase>`);
upload if absent. Check **all four** artifacts: both zips **and** the unzipped `.exe`s.
The bare exe usually scans clean; only the MOTW download trips it. (VT's GUI is
shadow-DOM heavy, so reading a verdict via DOM scraping needs shadow-root traversal.)

## Decide

- **Both VT (Microsoft = Undetected) and local Defender clean** → the verdict has aged out
  / is environment-specific. **Do not file a WDSI submission** (Microsoft would likely
  reject it as "not detected"). Reply to `Needs-Author-Feedback` with the evidence —
  the Defender **signature build** tested, VT links, "Microsoft: Undetected" — and ask
  the assigned/active moderator to re-run validation (`@wingetbot run` is
  moderator-triggered — an author/maintainer comment does not reliably start a run; the
  bot also auto-retries ~every 18h).
  *(0.20.0 / `microsoft/winget-pkgs#391230`.)*
- **Still reproducibly flagged** (local Defender and/or VT's Microsoft engine) → file a
  WDSI false-positive submission, then wait for propagation + re-run.
  *(0.19.1 / `microsoft/winget-pkgs#390120`.)*

## WDSI submission (only when reproducible)

<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission> → **Software developer** persona →
requires a Microsoft account sign-in **and a CAPTCHA** (human steps; not automatable).

- Submit the **flagged ZIP**. Defender blocks *copying* a quarantined file, so obtain an
  uploadable copy via a temporary exclusion: `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath <folder>`
  (admin), re-download into it, submit, then `Remove-MpPreference -ExclusionPath <folder>`.
- Fields: detection name, definition version, "Incorrectly detected as malware",
  company = your own name (ryl is a personal project, not an employer), notes cite the
  VT link.
- **"Accepted" ≠ propagated.** The per-submission details page can transiently error
  ("Unable to access your submission details") — that is not a failure; verify via the
  **submission history** list. After Microsoft clears it, propagation to the validator takes
  ~1–3 days; then re-run.

## Gotchas

- Cross-repo refs: always `microsoft/winget-pkgs#NNN`; a bare `#NNN` links to ryl (see the
  `filing-issues` skill).
- Never put a local home path or machine specifics in a public PR comment — use `$env:TEMP`
  or placeholders.
- **Delegating to a headless/WSL agent:** launch it with `cwd` = the ryl repo (so it loads
  this skill) and hand it the **full** step list (local Defender repro + VT for zips *and*
  exes + tie back to the PR). A prompt scoped to "scan the zips on VT" misses the
  reproduction and PR-triage half.

## History

- `microsoft/winget-pkgs#387703` (0.17.0, merged), `#390120` (0.19.1, `Wacatac.H!ml` —
  needed a WDSI submission + propagation), `#391230` (0.20.0, `Sprisky.U!cl` — transient;
  re-run requested, outcome pending as of writing).
- Durable fix: code signing (#342). Microsoft label reference:
